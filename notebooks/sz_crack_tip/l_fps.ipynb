    "- Linear elastic fracture mechanics assumes the size of the inelastic zone at the tip of the crack to be zero but it must in reality have a finite size $R$.\n",
    "- $R$ was estimated by Irwin for plastic materials and denotes the limit of the zone where the tensile strength is exceeded.\n",
    "- We will have a softening behavior at the tip of the crack for the case of quasi-brittle materials. To see how the softening influences the size of the fracture process zone, consider the approximation considered in figure. This assumption is similar to Irwin for estimate for ductile material but with an assumption that when the critical situation $K_I = K_{Ic}$ is reached, the point at the crack tip have already softened and the points ahead of it are in the intermediate states of fracture, in such a way that the stress distribution over the fracture process zone is linear. The result of this approximation is double Irwin's estimate. \n"
