    "- Step I: Deformation path is given as a function of two independent parameters of the shear deformation $\\Delta$ and crack opening $w$ illustrated in four different relations of $w/\\Delta$.\n",

    "- Step III: Pure shear is determined using the relation $w/\\Delta$ to determine shear and normal stresses in the crack due to aggregate interlock. \n",
    "- Step IV: Model I and Mode II models are combined for mixed mode simulation by superposing the normal stresses of mode I with those of mode II. The blue curve is attained through superposition.\n",

    "1. Formation of cracks occur under pure mode I condition after exceeding the biaxial tensile strength.\n",
